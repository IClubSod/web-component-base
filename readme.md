# Pure Web Component Demo

## Purpose
To demonstrate a simple, *purely* vanilla, standards-based design for building reusable web components.

## Features
- No framework or bulky library.
- Purely HTML5, CSS3, EMCAScript6, you know, the stuff your modern browser understands.
- Fully standards-based web components.
- No templating "engine", only **real HTML5** templates.
- I don't need to make claims about how fast it is, it's as fast as your browser, as it should be.
- You want documentation? Visit https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

## How to run
From the project root:

    % cd server
    % npm update
    % npm start

Then visit http://localhost:8080/
